Follows a modular package structure under com.klef.jfsd.exam.
RESTful service exposing endpoints to retrieve data from JSON Placeholder.
No database integration; relies entirely on external API communication.
Tested using Postman to validate operations.
Technologies Used
Java: Core language for the implementation.
Spring Boot: Framework for building and managing the microservice.
Maven: Dependency and build management.
Postman: For API testing.
